      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p>CTRL//FRAME began as a grassroots initiative to give young artists a platform to express themselves. What started as a small community project has grown into a vibrant organization with two creative branches,CTRL//FRAME was born from the idea that creativity isn‚Äôt confined‚Äîit moves from frame to frame, canvas to code. What started as a passion for pushing pixels became a mission to redefine digital expression. We took control of the canvas, rewrote the rules, and built a studio where design is fluid, interactive, and alive. Every project is a new frame in our story‚Äîeach one a chance to explore, disrupt, and create something that resonates.</p>

        <h3>üé¨ Frame by Frame</h3>
        <p>Focused on motion arts‚Äîfilm, animation, and video storytelling. Youth learn to script, shoot, and edit their visions into reality,At CTRL//FRAME, we believe creativity is a continuous motion‚Äîmoving frame to frame like a living storyboard. Each design, each interaction, each moment is part of a larger narrative. We don‚Äôt just build static visuals; we craft dynamic experiences that evolve, respond, and connect. From concept to execution, every frame is intentional, layered with meaning, and designed to move people.</p>

        <h3>üé® Canvas CTRL</h3>
        <p>Dedicated to visual arts‚Äîillustration, design, and mixed media. A space to experiment, remix, and redefine the canvas,To control the canvas is to reclaim creative freedom. CTRL//FRAME flips the traditional design process by giving creators the tools to command their own visual language. We don‚Äôt follow templates‚Äîwe rewrite them. Whether it‚Äôs code, motion, or layout, we treat the canvas as a playground for experimentation. ‚ÄúCanvas CTRL‚Äù is our philosophy: design without limits, expression without compromise.</p>
